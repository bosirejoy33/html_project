elephants over there. Nelson Oleraiya
drives us through his

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.340
community wildlife conservation area on
the edge of the Maasai Mara Game

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.300
Reserve. Five years ago, this land was an
overgrazed dust

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.140
bowl where people had put up fences that
blocked wildlife from their

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.060
traditional migratory routes. Community
elders had a big idea.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.280
They took down the fences, pulled their
land, and now live side by side

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.120
with wildlife. The community was facing a
freefall

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.840
in loss of land. So when we came in, we
had to get rid

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.820
of 25 kilometers long lines of fences.
It's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.680
high season here for tourists. Many are
heading to Maasai Mara to watch

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.640
the great wildebeest migration. Millions
of animals come from the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.080
Serengeti Game Reserve in Tanzania to
breed and graze.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.740
But for many years, local communities have
often been excluded

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.440
from the tourist dollars. So the Nashulai
Conservancy

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.360
decided to do things differently. We were
wary about

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.280
approaching those institutional funders
that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.040
funds fortress conservation, because then
they will

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.340
change our narrative. And we wanted to
pioneer

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.940
a model that is community-led. Their
vision

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.820
is ambitious. They want to create one of
the longest wildlife corridors

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.740
from Maasai Mara through other reserves
and onto the Serengeti.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.260
People who live in areas like this one say
they want to be more

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.000
involved in conservation efforts. And
that's why it's so important

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.640
for them to have this community
conservancies. And they are

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.400
thriving. Jack Olemoniko says his family
set aside

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.820
land for the protected area. Living
standard.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.380
Our standard of living has improved. We've
put aside money for our children's

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.560
education through a bursary fund. When
times are hard,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.780
especially during a drought, community
members dip into their contributions to

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.520
help provide food and other basic
commodities.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.320
Tourists often stop over at the village to
sample the traditional

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.160
way of life. This is not the only
community conservancy in Kenya,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.160
but people here believe that Nashulai has
set the pace for other conservation

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.020
initiatives, which they say can only be
good news.
